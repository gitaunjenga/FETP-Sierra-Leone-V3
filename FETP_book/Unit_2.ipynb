    "According to the 2021 Sierra Leone Health Information System (HIS) Policy, DHIS2 is the backbone of Sierra Leone‚Äôs HIS. It has served as the country‚Äôs electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (e-IDSR) since October 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integration of DHIS2 software with Open MRS software permitted the development of a basic hospital information system, implementations of case-based disease surveillance systems (i.e., DHIS2 Tracker) for HIV and IDSR cased-based system (eCBDS). A HIV Tracker is being piloted at several health facilities and the eCBDS Tracker has been rolled out nationwide. Community health information management has been integrated into the HMIS tools and as a result no standalone Community Health Information System (CHIS) exists. There is a national Logistics Management Information Systems (LMIS) platform for health logistics and commodities management and iHRIS for health workforce management. Three application esystems making up the LMIS are mSupply, Pharmaceutical Dashboard, and Channel. The RRIV forms have been fully integrated into DHIS2 and all districts are now entering data into DHIS2."
